EIM stands for *Economy Industry in Motion*.

This club strives the support of initialisation for enterprise class projects.

These projects are most of the time bigger than currently possible by an AFFILIATE(company or freelancer affiliated to EIM), as such there is a need for knowledge, information, workforce that is not yet available.

EIM aims to help with these projects and needs by having a pool of knowledge, information and affiliates to match for a wanted project. Working together to make sure that whatever you want 

EIM strives for quality of relationships and will help match the right affiliates for the projects.
